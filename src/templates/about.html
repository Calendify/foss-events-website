<section>
    <p>
        Planet Earth in its late 2010s: Europeans are facing massive right-wing populism with an uprise of right-wing
        movements in most parts of the continent. In just a little of time, nationalist parties and conservative leaders
        are tearing down fundamental freedoms. Freedoms that have taken decades to be introduced and established. We
        already suffer by new forms of political oppression and restrictions of freedom in many European member states.
        One can only speculate how the situation develops in the next decade or the one after, how borders and walls
        outside and within Europe will be re-established. But one can be sure that when crossing borders will become a
        privilege again, inter-European families, networks, communities and the whole civil society will get dispersed.
    </p>

    <p>
        To grow and live (in) a free society we need freedom of exchange. We need human cooperation as a breeding ground
        for creativity and inspiration as well as a fundament to safeguard our peace and mutual understanding. <strong>Freedom
        of people - just as freedom of code - is fundamental to Free, Libre and Open Source Software and their
        communities</strong> and a requirement to collectively construct our commons.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project shall help growing a free society. As long as inner-European borders can still be crossed and
        international events are possible, this page is here to encourage you to get to know and network with each
        other. Create international organisations, form resilient communities and build friendships between each other
        across borders. Go to a FOSS event in another country this year, an event where you have never been before. Get
        to know new people there, their habits, knowledge and backgrounds. Help each other and listen to each other. And
        above all do what you always love to do:
    </p>

    <p class="about-four-freedoms">
        <strong>Use, study, share and improve. Together.</strong>

    <p>
        // foss.events is about connecting people beyond borders and nations who understand the benefits of sharing
        knowledge and to collectively use, study, share and improve it for everyone. For this you find <a href="/">the most comprehensive list of Free, Libre and/or Open Source Software (related) events
        happening in Europe</a> on the front-page.
    </p>

    <p>
        Keep in mind that this website is a work in progress. It is built from scratch and step by step shall become a
        database-driven web-project for and by the FOSS community to help connecting people. If you are interested in

    <h2 class="h2 h2--left h2--standalone">about: criteria</h2>

    <p>
        // foss.events is all about collecting and spreading FOSS events in Europe. These are mainly conferences but can
        also be meetings, *-a-thons, camps, festivals, exhibitions and other kind of events - as long as they match the
        following criteria:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>only events that happen in Europe.</li>
        <li>only events that are open for the general public. Entrance fee is
            ok, but events shall be accessible for
            everyone to participate and in particular not restricted to a specific group like the members of a specific
            group, organisation or similar.
        </li>
        <li>only "full-day" events. As a rule of thumb, that means events that are at least 6-8 hours or more.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>If you know about a Free, Libre and/or Open Source Software event in Europe that matches this criteria and is not
        yet in our list, please contribute. [<a href="#contribute">&uarr;</a>]</p>

    <p>
        If you know of an event that matches our criteria [<a href="#criteria">&darr;</a>] and you do not see it
        mentioned in our list of events, please contribute. The easiest option is to simply copy-paste the URL of the
        event into the body section of <a
            href="mailto:onemore@foss.events?subject=one more event">an email</a> and after checking we will list it
        here. Also if you see that some information is missing on our side, use <a
            href="mailto:thesameemailaddress@foss.events?subject=one more event">the same email-address</a> and send us
        any missing information of the event.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are an organiser or you have 5 minutes of time, it would be of such a great help to this project if you

    <h2 class="h2 h2--left h2--standalone">about: freedom</h2>

    <p>
        We believe in the 4 freedoms to use, study, share and improve an software. Our page is self-made and published
        as FOSS under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">AGPLv3</a>. You can <a href="https://github.com/foss-events/website">find the code
        on github</a>.
    </p>


    <h3 id="diversity">about: diversity</h3>

    <p>
        There are reasons and arguments why some people prefer FOSS over FLOSS or vice versa, why some refer to Open
        Source and others to Free Software or Libre Software. And who knows, potentially in the next decade even a new
        term will be created ... (We heard sustainable software is an upcoming candidate.)
    </p>

    <p>
        At // foss.events we love this diversity. All these terms have their relevance and they allow us to put slightly
        different emphasis on the same technologies. Because apart from the actual naming and the details in the
        semantics, all these names technically refer to the same kind of software: Software that is published under a
        license that grants any user the 4 freedoms to use, study, share and improve the software without limitations.
        That is why on // foss.events we will not prefer one name over the other and in case we use one, it is
        representative to all the others.</p>

    <p> Let us unite in diversity: <strong>No matter the name, if your event is about the four freedoms of software your
        event is part of // foss.events!</strong>
