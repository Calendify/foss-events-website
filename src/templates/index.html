<div class="bgimp">

    <p>Planet Earth in its late 2010s: Europeans are facing an uprise of right-wing movements in most parts of the
        continent. New forms of political oppression and restrictions of freedom are put into practice, creating new
        deportation procedures, excessive police laws and border controls, new walls and entry bans. One can only
        speculate how the overall situation will develop in the next decade or the one after, how borders outside and
        within Europe will be re-established and potentially closed down ... But one can be sure that when crossing
        borders will become a privilege again, inter-European families, networks and communities will get dispersed.</p>

    <p>To grow and live (in) a free society we need freedom of exchange. We need human cooperation as a breeding ground
        for creativity and inspiration as well as a fundament to safeguard our peace and mutual understanding. Freedom
        of people - just as freedom of code - is fundamental to Free, Libre and Open Source Software and their
        communities and a requirement to collectively construct our commons. </p>


</div>

<p>This project shall help growing a free society. As long as inner-European borders can still be crossed and
    international events are possible, this page is here to encourage you to get to know and network with each other. Create international organisations, form resilient communities and build friendships with each other across borders.
    Go to a FOSS event in another country this year, an event where you have never been before. Get to know new people
    there, their habits, knowledge and backgrounds. Help each other and listen to each other. And above all do what you
    always love to do: <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@FOSS_events"> </a><a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@FLOSS_events"> </a><a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@3rik"> </a></p>

<h2 class="navhead" id="criteria">about: criteria</h2>
	
			<p>// foss.events is all about collecting and spreading FOSS events in Europe. These are mainly conferences but can also be meetings, *-a-thons, camps, festival, exhibitions and other kind of events - as long as they match the following criteria:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>only events that happen in Europe.</li>
				<li>only events that are open for the general public. Entrance fee is ok, but events shall be accessible for everyone to participate and in particular not restricted to a specific group like the members of a specific group, organisation or similar. </li>
				<li>only "full-day" events. As a rule of thumb, that means events that are at least 6-8 hours or more.</li> 
			</ul>
		
		
			<p>If you know about Free, Libre and/or Open Source Software event in Europe that matches this criteria and is not yet in our list, please [<a href="#contribute">&uarr;</a>]</p>

<h2 class="navhead" id="progress">about: progress</h2>
